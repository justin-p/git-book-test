# Bash hacking

## Path vulnerability

If something searches the Path for a a command and where able to replace the path we can trick the system to execute something else.  
Whenever we use `ls` it will now actually run `cat`.

```bash
export PATH="/tmp/tmp:${PATH}"
cp /bin/cat /tmp/tmp/cat
mv /tmp/tmp/cat /tmp/tmp/ls
```
